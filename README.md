[![Build LaTeX documents](https://github.com/spoto/blockchain-course/workflows/Build%20LaTeX%20documents/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spoto/blockchain-course/actions)

These are the slides of my course about blockchain technology at the
University of Verona, Italy.
You can download them as a zipped directory containing the PDF the slides,
from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w0pz4betj0wqurq/AACPpBQNkJhGGiX7u2xDu9yUa?dl=0">here</a>.
In alternative, you can regenerate the slides with the <code>build.sh</code> script
(requires <code>pdflatex</code>).
