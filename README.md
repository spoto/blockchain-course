These are the slides of my course about blockchain technology at the
University of Verona, Italy.
You can download them in PDF format, from
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w0pz4betj0wqurq/AACPpBQNkJhGGiX7u2xDu9yUa?dl=0">this link</a>.
In alternative, you can regenerate the slides with the <code>build.sh</code> script
(requires <code>pdflatex</code>).

These slides cover the following arguments:

* Introduction: introduction and history of the blockchain technology
* Bitcoin: the bitcoin blockchain
* Ethereum: the ethereum blockchain, including the Solidity language and smart contracts
* Tendermint: the tendermint engine for creating PoS blokchains, including Cosmos
* Hotmoka: the hotmoka nodes and the Takamaka language for smart programming contracts in Java
